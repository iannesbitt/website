As a former member of the software development team at [Raspberry Shake](https://raspberryshake.org), I had the opportunity to develop some of their cutting edge visualization tools, including [rsudp](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp). The company took the look and feel of rsudp and incorporated it into their online live streaming visualizations.

The way I got involved with Raspberry Shake initially was by administering my own seismic stations. After parting ways with the company, I remain a station administrator for several Shakes. Here are a few—displayed in the style of rsudp, of course.

The first is a station in Williamstown, MA:

The second is in Clarksburg, MA:

And the third is in the Earth and Climate Science building at the University of Maine:

The last station is on the first floor of a building with a basement and a lot of mechanical noise—which makes it somewhat difficult to detect earthquakes, but is instructive for geoscience students.
