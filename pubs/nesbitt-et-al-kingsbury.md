abstract: Freshwater lakes in the northern United States and Canada archive stratigraphy that can provide records of sediment supply since deglaciation. The records are unique due to the presence of glacial sediments, glacially-carved pools in the longitudinal profiles of stream and river valleys, and the influence of dams and human activities on surface water hydraulic conditions. We use ground-penetrating radar (GPR), sedimentary core analysis, acoustic bottom mapping, and existing high-resolution topography to investigate dynamics from para- and post-glacial periods through the present. We map sediment sources and the stratigraphy and volume of deposits associated with a 175 ha freshwater lake system with a 33.1 km2 watershed (Kingsbury Pond, central Maine, USA). 14C and core data analysis indicate that high inorganic sediment load dominated Kingsbury’s sedimentary environment until 8,550–8,410 cal yr BP—implying longer paraglacial conditions than assumed—after which sediment load decreased by more than an order of magnitude. 210Pb analysis shows a threefold sediment load increase since AD ~1960, coinciding with extensive disturbances from human activity, which exceeds empirical erosion estimates for this watershed by a factor of five. We suggest our methods could be used throughout New England because the generally low water conductivity allows effective use of GPR.
