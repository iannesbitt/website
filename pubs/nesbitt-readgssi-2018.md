abstract: readgssi is a command line tool that can aid in post-processing and figure creation of survey lines from Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporated (GSSI) fixed-aperture ground-penetrating radar (GPR) datasets. readgssi is scriptable and processes files faster than the manufacturer's proprietary software. The software is able to produce publication-quality profile figures from a wide range of GSSI antennas and control units, as well as a broad range of survey media (water, ice, gravel, sand, silt, and concrete).
plaintextabstract: readgssi is software that can create figures from certain types of Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporated (GSSI) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. The software is faster than the manufacturer's software and can be used in automated computing scripts to make processing entire datasets efficient and reproducible. readgssi can produce publication-quality figures from a wide range of GSSI instruments over many types of survey subjects (water, ice, gravel, sand, silt, and concrete).
